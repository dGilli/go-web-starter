# About go-web-starter

This is a webapp starter for living the minimal life.

Make sure you have Tailwinds [Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) and the [Templ CLI](https://templ.guide/quick-start/installation) installed and in your `PATH`.

- [Echo]() as a tiny web framework.
- Type-safe templating with [Templ]().
- [HTMX]() enhances HTML with AJAX and other dynamic behaviors.
- [AlpineJs]() a JS framework for dynamic, reactive client-side interactions.
- Utility-first CSS framework with [TailwindCSS]().
- [Embedding]() assets directly into a single binary
- Customizable icon webfonts via [Fontello]().

**Roadmap:**

- Re-compile and browser auto-refresh on file changes
- Demo a HTMX form
- Demo reactivity with AlpineJs
